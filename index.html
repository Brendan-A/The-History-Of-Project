                <h2>Starting the <br>Project</h2>
                <p>Neil Cicierega released three instrumental albums under the name "Trapezoid," which was changed retroactively to "Deporitaz" as an existing band called Trapezoid demanded that he change it. On the change to Lemon Demon, he said: "Eventually I started experimenting with singing, and once I felt ready to do that full time, I christened myself Lemon Demon and went into it head on." On January 21st, 2003, Neil released Lemon Demon's first song, "Don't Be Like the Sun" and the rest is history!</p>

                            <p>On the heels of Neil's mostly instrumental releases under the Trapezoid/Deporitaz banner, Clown Circus was his first real foray into music with vocals. He was only 15 when this album came out and the quality is understandably rough. Clown Circus features guest vocals from several of Neil's friends at the time.</p>
    
                            <p>After only 3 months, Lemon Demon released his second album titled, Live From The Haunted Candle Shop, not much is known about the development, however with the quick release after Clown Circus, it shows that Lemon Demon is still finding its footing in the world of music.</p>
                            
                            <p>Later in 2004 the third album titled, Hip to the Javabean, came out and shown massive improvement upon the first two albums produced with cleaner instruments used and louder vocals.</p>
                            
                            <p>In 2009, all these albums would be rereleased on Bandcamp for free and in 2023, Hip to the Javabean would be rereleased under Needlejuice Records</p>

                            <h2>Evolving <br>the <br>Style</h2>
                            <p>In late 2005 Lemon Demon released a song called "The Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate Destiny" alongside a flash animation by Shawn Vulliez. To date it's my biggest hit, getting millions of views and even some radio play.</p>
        
                            <p>Following the hype of The Ultimate Showdown animation, Lemon Demon released their fourth album, Damn Skippy to keep attention on them while finishing the song which would later be put on the fifth album, Dinosaurchestra. Damn Skippy would be the first album to be released with commentary over the songs about what it took to produced each of them.</p>
                                
                            <p>The year is now 2008 and fans were eagerly waiting the next release which would come on August 1st, the sixth album titled, View-Monster which until the latest release would be considered the best album to date!</p>
                                
                            <p>A short album of Christmas-themed music with a classically weird, creepy Lemon Demon twist was released in 2009. “I am Become Christmas” was put together with uncharacteristic speed, as Neil said that it was only conceived on around December 1st, this would be the last major release from Lemon Demon for quite a while.</p>

                            <h2>Evolving <br>the <br>Style</h2>
                            <p>After the release of View-Monster in 2008, there was a very long stretch of time before the next Lemon Demon LP came out. There were some EPs released during this time such as I Am Become Christmas, Lemon Demon continued to play live shows, mostly at Youmacon. Neil made some other more important decisions, like moving to the big city, getting married, and making Smash Mouth mashups under his real name all the while he was working on the next album.</p>
        
                            <p>Nature Tapes was the next major release as an EP and is a short compilation of songs that Neil had already released individually. At one point, he was considering making it a double album with Spirit Phone, which was still unfinished at that time. Taken as a group, the songs on Nature Tapes can be seen as a bit of a departure from the Lemon Demon status quo, as Neil repeatedly swears and the surreality of the lyrics is taken up to eleven.</p>
                                
                            <p>Finally, on February 29, 2016, Spirit Phone was released. Eight years in the making, Spirit Phone is Neil's most popular album to date and widely considered his magnum opus. It features a cavalcade of energetic songs about fun, spooky topics like cursed arcade cabinets and a mellified man— as well as hints of real life frights such as capitalism and toxic masculinity. In 2018, SP became the first Lemon Demon album to be physically released by Needlejuice Records, with audio remastered by Mark Kramer.</p>

                <h2><span>Modern Day</span> Lemon Demon</h2>
                <p>When Spirit Phone was released. It's widely considered to be the best Lemon Demon album yet, demonstrating the massive improvements Neil had made to his musical skills over the previous 8 years. The release of Spirit Phone, followed by Mouth Moods in 2017, created a great deal of attention toward Neil and his music. A new generation of Lemon Demon fans emerged, sharing their love for the music on Tumblr and Twitter. These fans would continue to pour support for Neil and his music to current day without any major release in music since 2016!</p>

                    <p>While Neil hasn’t published any new albums since the major hit of Spirit Phone, fans continued to listen to it due to its unique music style of combining rock and synth as well as the witty writing style of the lyrics. Fans showed support through art and animation, such as hosting a multiple animator project for the 15th anniversary of The Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate Destiny, and other notable songs such as Touch-Tone Telephone and Cabinet Man.</p> 

                    <p>The future looks bright as in early 2023, Neil published 14 incomplete demos of upcoming Lemon Demon songs to his Patreon meaning that a new album will surely come around soon!</p>
